When trying to add commas into the values . 

Error Overview:
The error was a JSX syntax error:

CopyInsert
Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <View>.
This happened because the renderVisibleItem function accidentally had duplicate returns and fragments, which broke the normal React requirement that every JSX block must return a single parent element. As a result, the code failed to compile.

How we could have foreseen this:

By carefully reviewing the function after edits, especially when copy-pasting or merging blocks, to ensure only one return and one parent element.
Running a quick format/lint (or IDE auto-format) would have highlighted the duplicate/stray fragments and returns.
Noticing that the function body had both a return and a stray block with another return (a common merge/copy-paste pitfall).
Summary:
This type of error is best avoided by always checking for a single return and a single parent JSX element in every React component or render function after making structural changes.

Here’s a concise overview of the main issues we’ve faced on the create.tsx (Create Invoice) page, with examples of what we’ve fixed:

Issues Encountered & Examples Fixed
JSX Structure Errors
Stray or duplicate JSX elements outside the main return, causing “Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped” errors.
Example fix: Wrapped <Text> and <Image> for the PayPal label inside a single <View>.
Unwrapped JSX Siblings
Multiple JSX elements at the same level not wrapped in a parent, breaking the render.
Example fix: Ensured all JSX returned from the component is inside a single parent <View> or fragment.
Misplaced or Extra Closing Tags
Extra </View> or misplaced tags leading to syntax errors.
Example fix: Removed unnecessary nested or stray closing tags after the PayPal label.
Undefined Variables/Props
Usage of variables like themeColors, iconStyle, handlePaymentMethodToggle, etc., that were not defined or imported.
Example fix: Highlighted missing variable errors and recommended checking their declarations/imports.
TypeScript Errors
Property assignment errors, missing types, or parameters (e.g., Cannot find name 'getValues', “Property assignment expected”).
Example fix: Pointed out missing handlers and props, suggesting a review of component scope and props.
Summary Bullet Points
Fixed stray and unwrapped JSX elements in the return statement.
Removed extra or misplaced closing tags that broke the JSX structure.
Identified and flagged missing variables, handlers, and TypeScript errors for further repair.
Ensured the PayPal label and similar UI are wrapped in a single parent <View>.
Next:
We should review and repair any remaining missing variables, handlers, and ensure the full return statement is syntactically correct and all props are defined. Let me know if you want a full pass to fix all remaining issues!


Error Explanation:
You are getting a "SyntaxError: Unexpected token" at

typescript
CopyInsert
}, [user, supabase]);
because this line is trying to close a useEffect React hook, but the opening part (useEffect(() => {) is missing above it. The code block is incomplete, so the parser gets confused.

How to Fix:
Add useEffect(() => { before fetchBusinessSettings(); so the code becomes:

typescript
CopyInsert
useEffect(() => {
  fetchBusinessSettings();
}, [user, supabase]);
This creates a valid effect block and resolves the syntax error.
