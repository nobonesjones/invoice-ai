# Subscription Purchase Flow Fix

## Issue
Continue button not working on iPad Air 11-inch (M2) with iPadOS 18.6

## App Store Requirements
1. **Paid Apps Agreement**: Must be accepted in App Store Connect Business section
2. **Receipt Validation**: Server must handle both production and sandbox receipts

## Code Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added iPad-specific error detection in `revenueCatService.ts`
- Added timeout handling for paywall presentation
- Improved logging for debugging purchase issues

### 2. Platform-Specific Debugging
- Added Platform detection in `newsettings.tsx`
- Enhanced error messages for iPad users
- Added fallback placement handling

### 3. Receipt Validation
- Enhanced error handling for sandbox/production receipt mismatches
- Added specific error messages for validation issues

## App Store Connect Requirements

### Business Section - Paid Apps Agreement
The account holder must accept the Paid Apps Agreement:
1. Go to App Store Connect
2. Navigate to Business section
3. Accept the Paid Apps Agreement

### Receipt Validation (Server-side)
Server should validate receipts in this order:
1. Try production App Store first
2. If error "Sandbox receipt used in production", validate against test environment

## Testing Steps
1. Test on iPad Air 11-inch (M2) with iPadOS 18.6
2. Verify Continue button works
3. Check receipt validation flow
4. Test both sandbox and production purchases

## Notes
- The app uses Superwall for paywall management
- RevenueCat handles receipt validation
- Issue may be related to Superwall + iPad interaction
