# Audio Recording Implementation

## What We Learned from Testing

Through our test implementation, we discovered several key insights about implementing audio recording in our Expo React Native application:

### Core Implementation

1. **Permission Handling**
   - Audio recording requires explicit permission from the user
   - We must request permissions using `Audio.requestPermissionsAsync()`
   - Always check permission status before attempting to record

2. **Audio Session Configuration**
   - Configure the audio session with `Audio.setAudioModeAsync()`
   - Important settings include:
     - `allowsRecordingIOS: true` - Enables recording on iOS
     - `playsInSilentModeIOS: true` - Allows playback when device is in silent mode
     - `interruptionModeIOS` and `interruptionModeAndroid` - Control behavior when interrupted

3. **Recording Process**
   - Create a recording instance with `Audio.Recording.createAsync()`
   - Use `Audio.RecordingOptionsPresets.HIGH_QUALITY` for good quality recordings
   - Store the recording reference in state for later access
   - Stop recording with `recording.stopAndUnloadAsync()`
   - Get the URI with `recording.getURI()`

4. **Playback**
   - Create a sound object from the recording with `recording.createNewLoadedSoundAsync()`
   - Play the sound with `sound.replayAsync()`
   - Check `status.isLoaded` before accessing properties like `durationMillis`

### UI/UX Considerations

1. **Button States**
   - Clearly indicate recording state with different button text and colors
   - Use red for "Stop Recording" to indicate active recording
   - Use blue for "Start Recording" in the idle state

2. **User Feedback**
   - Provide visual feedback when recording is active
   - Display a list of recordings for easy access
   - Show recording duration for reference

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling for permission denials
   - Handle recording failures gracefully
   - Provide clear error messages to the user

## Implementation on the Real Meetings Page

To implement these learnings on the real meetings page, we should:

1. Ensure proper permission handling is in place
2. Configure audio sessions correctly
3. Implement clear UI state changes during recording
4. Provide proper error handling and user feedback
5. Ensure recordings are properly saved and can be played back

The simplified implementation from our test page can be adapted to the more complex meetings page while maintaining the core functionality that we've proven works.
