# ðŸ“Š Trackable Invoice Links with www.getsuperinvoice.com

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Your SuperInvoice app now has a comprehensive trackable invoice sharing system integrated with your domain `www.getsuperinvoice.com`. This feature allows you to:

- **Generate secure, trackable links** for invoices
- **Monitor who opens your invoices** with detailed analytics
- **Track downloads, prints, and interactions** in real-time
- **View comprehensive history** of all invoice activities
- **Automatic geolocation tracking** for visitor insights

## ðŸ”— How It Works

### 1. **Link Generation**
When you send an invoice via "Share Link":
- A unique token is generated (e.g., `abc123xyz`)
- Link format: `https://www.getsuperinvoice.com/shared/invoice/abc123xyz`
- Links expire after 30 days by default
- Each invoice can have multiple active links

### 2. **Tracking Events**
The system automatically tracks:
- **Views**: When someone opens the link
- **Downloads**: When the PDF is downloaded
- **Prints**: When the invoice is printed
- **Location**: Country and city of visitors
- **Device Info**: Browser and device details

### 3. **Analytics Dashboard**
