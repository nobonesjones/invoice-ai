# Onboarding & Authentication Handover Document

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE - User Session/Authentication Bug**

**Status**: URGENT - Needs immediate investigation  
**Issue**: Users seeing data from previous/different users after onboarding  
**Impact**: Critical security and UX issue

---

## üìã **Current Problem**

User reports that after completing onboarding:
- Logo uploaded during onboarding is not appearing in business information screen
- Business name showing data from a different/previous user
- Suggests user session/authentication is mixing up users

---

## üîß **Recent Changes Made**

### **1. Logo Upload Fix (COMPLETED)**
**File**: `/context/onboarding-provider.tsx` (lines 235-309)

**Problem**: Logo uploads during onboarding were saving local file URIs instead of uploading to Supabase storage.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added proper logo upload logic to `saveOnboardingData()`
- Detects local file URIs (`file://` or `ph://`)
- Uploads to Supabase storage via edge function
- Saves public URL to database

### **2. Mixpanel Removal (COMPLETED)**
**Status**: All analytics calls removed for App Store build

**Files Cleaned**:
- `app/(app)/(protected)/ai.tsx` - Removed AI chat tracking
- `app/(auth)/onboarding-4.tsx` - Removed industry tracking
- `components/auth/sign-up-modal.tsx` - Removed signup tracking
- `app/(app)/(protected)/invoices/AddNewItemFormSheet.tsx` - Removed creation tracking
- `app/(app)/(protected)/estimates/create.tsx` - Removed creation tracking

**Note**: Analytics service files kept for future re-enabling

### **3. Debug Logging Added (IN PROGRESS)**
**Files Modified**:
- `/context/onboarding-provider.tsx` - Added extensive debug logging
- `/app/(app)/business-information.tsx` - Added session debug logging

---

## üîç **Debug Investigation Started**

### **Added Logging Points**:

**Onboarding Provider** (`saveOnboardingData` function):
```
[OnboardingProvider] üö® SAVE ONBOARDING DEBUG - Start
[OnboardingProvider] üîç SESSION DEBUG:
  - Current session user: [USER_ID]
  - Current session email: [EMAIL]
  - userId we will save with: [USER_ID]
  - Are they the same? [BOOLEAN]
```

**Business Information Screen** (`fetchBusinessInfo` function):
```
[BusinessInfo] üö® FETCH DEBUG - Start
[BusinessInfo] Session user ID: [USER_ID]  
[BusinessInfo] üîç QUERY RESULT:
  - Business name: [NAME]
  - Logo URL: [URL]
  - Data user_id: [USER_ID]
```

---

## üéØ **Next Steps for Investigation**

### **Immediate Actions Required**:

1. **Test User Flow**:
   - Create new user account
   - Complete full onboarding with logo upload
   - Check console logs for debug messages
   - Navigate to business information screen

2. **Analyze Debug Output**:
   - Compare user IDs between onboarding save and business info fetch
   - Check if session user emails match
   - Verify if data is being saved with correct user_id

3. **Potential Root Causes to Check**:
   - Session persistence issues
   - User ID parameter passing errors
   - AsyncStorage caching stale user data
   - Supabase auth session timing issues
   - Multiple users on same device/session conflicts

### **Key Files to Focus On**:

**Primary Investigation**:
- `/context/onboarding-provider.tsx` - Where data gets saved
- `/app/(app)/business-information.tsx` - Where data gets loaded
- `/context/supabase-provider.tsx` - Session management

**Secondary Check**:
- All files calling `saveOnboardingData()`:
  - `/app/(auth)/onboarding-1.tsx:114`
  - `/app/(app)/welcome.tsx:45`
  - `/components/auth/auth-modal.tsx:122`
  - `/components/auth/sign-up-modal.tsx` (multiple calls)

---

## üìä **Database Schema**

**Table**: `business_settings`
**Key Fields**:
- `user_id` (UUID) - Links to authenticated user
- `business_name` (text)
- `business_logo_url` (text) - Public Supabase storage URL
- `business_address` (text)
- `business_email` (text)

---

## üö® **Security Implications**

This is a **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE** if confirmed:
- Users could see other users' business data
- Data privacy violation
- Potential GDPR/compliance issues
- Must be fixed before App Store submission

---

## üí° **Recommended Investigation Approach**

1. **Run test with debug logging** (logs will reveal the issue)
2. **Check session consistency** across the onboarding flow
3. **Verify user_id parameter passing** in all `saveOnboardingData()` calls
4. **Test with multiple users** on same device
5. **Check AsyncStorage** for cross-user data pollution

## üìù **Current Status**

- ‚úÖ Logo upload logic fixed
- ‚úÖ Debug logging added
- ‚úÖ Mixpanel removed for App Store
- üö® **USER SESSION BUG** - Needs immediate investigation
- ‚è≥ Waiting for debug test results

---

**Priority**: **URGENT** - This blocks App Store submission due to security concerns.
