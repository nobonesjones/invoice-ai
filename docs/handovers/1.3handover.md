me functonality we saved from the add item modal. but before we do that lets summarise where we are before the chat companys and create a plan for this next stage to make the add item work.

**Creating a plan summary**

I need to provide a concise plan and summary for the user. I should avoid length
y text and focus on delivering clear steps in bullet points. It seems we don’t n
eed to call the update_plan tool, as that’s not necessary here. While the develo
per tool suggests using the plan tool for multi-step processes, it’s not require
d right now. I’ll ensure my response aligns with the user’s request for a summar
y and a plan.**Summarizing the current project state**

I’ll include a current state summary that highlights the stability of tax and di
scount modals, fixes to the estimated discount row, and ongoing issues like the 
ds and BottomSheet configurations. I’ll also work on a parallel component for te
sting while keeping the original file.**Planning diagnostics and actions**

I’m focusing on diagnostics and necessary actions to address the crash. First, I
’ll capture details using in-app debug, including a try/catch around `handlePres
ent` and logs of the props.

The acceptance criteria are set, and for required actions, I need to fix the `EX
PO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in the preview build and conduct tests. To meet the user's re
quest to avoid full screen, I'll propose cloning the existing component.

I’ll create `AddItemSheet_Stable.tsx` with minimal UI, replace it in `invoices/c
reate.tsx`, and incrementally reintegrate features, ensuring all BottomSheet pro
ps are matched accurately. Keeping things concise is key!**Organizing the final 
response**

I need to include a smart fix for the API URL by making sure the environment in 
the preview profile is correct before rebuilding. It might not be necessary to i
nclude time estimates for the plan, but I’ll keep this organized.

I’ll create a concise final answer with headers formatted as follows: Summary, C
urrent Changes, Likely Cause, Plan, and Next Steps. Each section will be clear t
o ensure the user gets the essential information without any extra fluff. Keepin
g things concise is definitely the goal!

Here’s a crisp snapshot and a focused plan to land this.

**Where We Are**
- Stable: Tax modal, Discount modal (with keyboard snap), discount row on estima
tes.
- Unstable: Add Item sheet crashes on open.
- Changes tried: TextInput + FlatList, present-then-fetch, backdrop close, safe-
area inset, lock parent when child open, unified Supabase client, error boundary
 logging.
- Connectivity: VPN unblocks Supabase in Dubai. Preview OTA is manual via Custom
er Support.

**Likely Cause**
- A subtle BottomSheet + list/input lifecycle mismatch unique to this sheet:
  - Timing/race between present(), first render, and fetch updating list.
  - Prop differences vs Client sheet (snap points, index, pan/down, dynamic sizi
ng).
  - State resets on reopen and child-sheet interactions.

**Nuke Plan (Clone → Prove Stable → Re-layer Features)**
1) Clone the stable Client sheet
- Create `AddItemSheetStable` by copying `CreateNewClientSheet` structure.
- Keep exact BottomSheet config: `snapPoints=["70%","90%"]`, `enablePanDownToClo
se={!isLoading}`, `keyboardBehavior="extend"`, backdrop `pressBehavior="close"`,
 no dynamic sizing.

2) Prove stability with minimal UI
- Replace form with:
  - Header (“Add Item or Service”)
  - Search `TextInput`
  - FlatList of static mock items (no Supabase yet)
- Wire `present()/dismiss()` exactly like client; confirm open/close works repea
tedly.

3) Reintroduce features incrementally
- Add Supabase fetch (auth.getUser → user_saved_items list), set state only afte
r sheet is open.
- Add selection callback to parent; ensure it dismisses cleanly.
- Add “Add New Item” child sheet trigger and locking behavior (parent disables p
an while child open).

4) Swap in behind a flag
- In `invoices/create.tsx`, switch to `AddItemSheetStable` (feature flag constan
- Keep old `AddItemSheet` in repo until the new one is confirmed.

5) Harden reopen lifecycle
- On `onDismiss`: clear search, cancel inflight fetch (AbortController), and res
et list state.
- On `present`: present first, then start fetch with a short delay (just like cl
ient autofocus timing).

**Diagnostics While Iterating**
- “Last Crash” panel in `superinvoice://test/debug` will capture real JS error +
 stack.
- Add one-time logs: `present()`, `onChange(index)`, `fetch start/end`, item cou
nts, and child sheet open/close.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Open/close Add Item repeatedly without crash.
- Search, select saved item, and “Add New” → Save flows work.
- Keyboard lift feels consistent with Tax/Discount.

**What You Do Now**
- Confirm preview env URL is exact (no typos) and rebuild preview once if needed
.
- I’ll implement the clone (`AddItemSheetStable`), wire the flag, and reintroduc
e features stepwise. Then we’ll OTA each step for verification.

Want me to start the clone now and gate it behind a simple `USE_STABLE_ADD_ITEM`
 flag in `invoices/create.tsx`?

can you summarise what we are doing right not please and the build and method we are usign for testing. 
**Preparing concise summary**

I think the user is looking for a clear and concise summary of what I'm currentl
y working on and the testing methods involved. It’s important to focus on clarit
y so they can easily understand the process. I'll make sure to present this info
rmation in an organized way that highlights the key aspects of our work. Keeping
 things simple is essential, so I’ll avoid any unnecessary jargon. I want to ens
ure the user feels informed!**Summarizing current tasks**

I'm outlining my current focus with clear bullet points. Right now, I'm working 
on the Estimates Add Item flow and adjusting the modal behavior. I’ve shipped ch
anges via OTA and am testing on an iPhone. For invoices, there's still some inst
ability, but I’ve set up paths for stability. My debugging approach includes an 
in-app route for crash logs, and I have steps lined up to verify functionality. 
Lastly, I’ll ensure VPN is used correctly for network requests.**Outlining next 
steps**

I need to provide clear and concise next steps, sticking to a structured bullet 
format. It’s important to keep things brief so that the user can quickly grasp t
he ideas. I’ll ensure each point is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary detail
s while covering the essential actions that need to be taken. Clarity is key her
e, and I want to make sure everything is easy to understand and follow. Let's ge
t right to presenting those bullets!

Here’s the quick snapshot of what we’re doing and how we’re testing.

- Scope: Stabilize Estimates “Add Item”
  - Sheet opens at 95%, keyboard up, cursor in “Item Name”.
  - Description field is single-line (no multi-line glitches).
  - Parent remains a sheet component but only hands off to the child right now.

- Status: Changes shipped via OTA (no rebuild)
  - Channel: preview (manual apply).
  - Apply on device: Customer Support → “Check for Update”.
  - If it doesn’t show, confirm you’re on the latest preview binary.

- Build/Testing method
  - Binary: one “preview” build installed previously (has expo-updates).
  - JS updates: eas update --branch preview --message "<note>" → tap “Check for 
Update” in app.
  - Device: iPhone; VPN ON in Dubai to avoid supabase.co DNS blocks.

- Debug tools
  - In‑app logs: superinvoice://test/debug (Last Crash + recent logs).
  - We’re adding small “[present] …” logs around the sheets if needed.

- Invoices “Add Item”
  - Still unstable; created a stable clone pattern and will port once Estimates 
is verified solid.

- What to do now
  - Test Estimates: Add item → sheet at 95% → keyboard up → add/save item.
  - If it doesn’t open: check superinvoice://test/debug and tell me if “[present
]” lines appear.
