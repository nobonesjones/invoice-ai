# 🔒 Security Configuration

## Current Security Status: ⚠️  DEVELOPMENT ONLY

This app currently has a **client-side only architecture** which exposes API keys in the bundled application. While suitable for development and testing, this architecture has **critical security vulnerabilities** for production use.

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues

### 1. Exposed API Keys
All API keys are currently embedded in the client application and can be extracted by anyone:

- **OpenAI API Key**: Exposed in client bundle → Cost abuse risk
- **Gemini API Key**: Exposed in client bundle → Cost abuse risk  
- **Supabase Service Role Key**: Exposed in client bundle → **CRITICAL: Full database access**

### 2. Cost & Abuse Risks
- Users can extract API keys and use them directly
- No rate limiting on client-side API calls
- Potential for significant unexpected costs

## 🛡️ Immediate Security Measures Taken

### ✅ Completed
1. **Environment variables properly ignored** in `.gitignore`
2. **Example environment file** created with security warnings
3. **Security documentation** created (this file)
4. **Client-safe keys identified**: Superwall & RevenueCat (designed for client-side)

### 🔄 Currently Acceptable for Client-Side
These keys are designed to be client-side and have built-in protections:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPERWALL_API_KEY` - Public key with built-in restrictions
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY` - Designed for client-side usage
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY` - Supabase anon key (when properly configured with RLS)

## 🏗️ Production Security Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate (Pre-Launch)
1. **Remove service role key** from client entirely
2. **Implement Supabase RLS policies** for data protection
3. **Set up API key rotation** schedule

### Phase 2: Backend Integration
1. **Create backend API** for AI services (OpenAI, Gemini)
2. **Move sensitive operations** server-side
3. **Implement rate limiting** and usage monitoring
4. **Add user authentication** for API access

### Phase 3: Advanced Security
1. **API key per user** with usage limits
2. **Real-time monitoring** and alerting
3. **Advanced threat detection**

## 🚀 Quick Production Fix

For immediate production deployment, consider:

```javascript
// Instead of direct API calls, proxy through Supabase Edge Functions
const response = await supabase.functions.invoke('openai-proxy', {
  body: { messages, model }
})
```

This keeps API keys server-side while maintaining the current architecture.

## 📞 Emergency Contacts

If API key compromise is suspected:
1. **Immediately rotate** all API keys
2. **Monitor usage** dashboards for unusual activity
3. **Review recent** application deployments
4. **Check** version control history for exposed keys

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Before App Store submission**: Remove or secure service role key
2. **Monitor this issue**: Set up basic usage alerts
3. **Plan backend migration**: For post-launch security improvements
